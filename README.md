# 🚀 Learning FPGA with Wukong Board (XC7A100T)

Welcome to my learning journey! This repository is dedicated to my progress in programming **Xilinx Artix-7 FPGAs** using the **QMTECH Wukong Board**.

The goal of this project is to document my learning process, store the programs I develop, and organize the best resources I find online.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Hardware:** QMTECH Wukong Board (Xilinx XC7A100T)
* **Development Tools:** * **Vivado Design Suite** (for HDL synthesis and constraints)
    * **Arduino IDE** (for programs targeting embedded soft-cores/SoC)
* **Languages:** Verilog / VHDL / C++

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **`/projects`**: My custom FPGA designs and source code.
- **`/resources`**: External links, tutorials, and local documentation.
- **`/constraints`**: `.xdc` files specifically for the Wukong Board pinout.
- **`/arduino`**: C++ programs and sketches for embedded implementations.

## 🚀 Getting Started
If you are also using the Wukong board:
1. Ensure you have the **Xilinx Vivado** tools installed.
2. Check the `constraints/` folder for the correct pin mapping.
3. For SoC projects, I use the **Arduino IDE** for quick prototyping on the processor side.
