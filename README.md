# 🚀 FPGA Learning Journey: VHDL & Verilog

Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to mastering FPGA development. This space serves as a central hub for the code I write and the best resources I discover while learning **VHDL** and **Verilog**.

---

## 🏗️ Development Platforms
My learning is organized by development boards and manufacturers:

### 🔹 Xilinx (Artix-7)
* Focused on the **QMTECH Wukong Board (XC7A100T)**.
* Working with professional FPGA design flows and hardware constraints.

### 🔹 Intel / Altera
* Projects targeting **Cyclone IV**, **Cyclone V (DE10-Nano)**, and **MAX II** CPLDs.
* Implementing classic designs like "Blink" and peripheral controllers.

---

## 📂 Repository Contents
* **`/Artix100T`**: Specific projects for the Wukong board.
* **`/Cyclone...` & `/Max II`**: Designs for Altera hardware.
* **`/VHDL`**: Pure VHDL implementations and logic exercises.
* **`/_logic analyzer`**: Tools and captures for debugging digital signals.
* **`useful_links.md`**: A curated list of external documentation and repositories.

## 📖 My Learning Goals
1.  **Language Mastery**: Transitioning fluently between Verilog and VHDL.
2.  **Cross-Platform Skills**: Understanding the differences between Xilinx and Altera/Intel environments.
3.  **Open Source Sharing**: Documenting my progress to help other beginners in the FPGA community.
