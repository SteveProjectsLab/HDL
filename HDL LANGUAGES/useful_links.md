## 📚 Essential Reading
* **[Digital Design and Computer Architecture](https://www.elsevier.com/books/digital-design-and-computer-architecture/harris/978-0-12-394424-5)** (Harris & Harris): The gold standard for beginners. It bridges the gap between digital logic and full computer architecture (MIPS/RISC-V).
* **[RTL Hardware Design Using VHDL](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/RTL+Hardware+Design+Using+VHDL:+Coding+for+Efficiency,+Portability,+and+Scalability-p-9780471720928)** (Pong P. Chu): An indispensable guide for writing synthesis-friendly code and understanding timing/resource constraints.
* **[The Designer's Guide to VHDL](https://www.elsevier.com/books/the-designers-guide-to-vhdl/ashenden/978-0-12-088785-0)** (Peter Ashenden): A comprehensive reference for the VHDL language syntax and advanced features.
* **[Effective VHDL](https://leanpub.com/effectivevhdl)** (Doug Smith): Focuses on industry best practices and solving real-world design challenges efficiently.

## 📦 Libraries & IP Cores
* **[The PoC-Library](https://github.com/VHDL/PoC)**: A massive library of parameterized and platform-independent VHDL components (from basic gates to memory controllers).
* **[OpenCores](https://opencores.org)**: The classic gateway for open-source hardware IP (CPUs, DSPs, and complex interfaces).
* **[NEORV32](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32)**: A highly-efficient RISC-V processor implementation. Perfect for studying clean, modern VHDL architecture.
* **[VHDL-extras](https://github.com/kevinpt/vhdl-extras)**: Provides common digital components (synchronizers, CRCs, I2C/UART) that complement the standard IEEE libraries.
* **[GRLIB IP Library](https://www.gaissler.com/index.php/products/ipcores/soclib)**: Professional-grade IP library by Cobham Gaisler, including the LEON3 processor and AMBA bus components.

## 🧪 Verification & Frameworks
* **[OSVVM (Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology)](https://github.com/OSVVM/OsvvmLibraries)**: Advanced functional verification library for constrained random testing and coverage.
* **[UVVM (Universal VHDL Verification Methodology)](https://github.com/UVVM/UVVM)**: A modular framework for creating high-quality, readable testbenches.
* **[VUnit](https://github.com/VUnit/vunit)**: An open-source unit testing framework that automates simulation runs and handles library dependencies.

## 🛠️ Open Source Toolchain
* **[GHDL](https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl)**: The leading open-source VHDL simulator with full IEEE support.
* **[GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/)**: A fully featured wave viewer to analyze `.vcd` or `.ghw` simulation outputs.
